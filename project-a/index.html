                <p>“Its appearance resembles that of a virus, and it moves by waving its legs. It can adapt to environmental changes by shifting its color, 
                  turning from black to blue and then back to black.”</p>

                “It is a newly discovered species living in the waters of Antarctica, thriving in extremely low temperatures. Due to its life in the dark depths of the ocean, 
                its color is deep blue. So far, only one individual has been found, and it is not easy to survive. It enjoys wandering among aquatic plants, with ice attached 
                to its surroundings.Its diet consists of marine pollutants such as plastic and discarded metals, though it consumes only small amounts at a time. After eating, 
                it grows larger, but excessive consumption will lead to its death. Once it reaches a certain size, it will reproduce on its own. However, its offspring remain 
                attached to the mother and cannot survive independently. If the mother dies, the offspring will also perish.Currently, it is being preserved in the ZACH Laboratory.”
